## ABSTRACT
Perhaps the most well-documented neutral model of biodiversity is the Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity (UNTB), however there is some controversy concerning the utility of UNTB compared to other null models og biodiversity.  UNTB postulates that species richness and abundance is generated exclusively through genetic drift between species.  Consequently, one should expect that a community governed by UNTB would have predominantly random species associations at any given point in time.  For this study we analyzed tree species associations on Barro Colorado Island in Panama.  Rank abundance of all individuals in the study site followed a log normal distribution.  Among sites, we found that only 21.3% of tree associations were nonrandom, of which 64.64% were positive associations and 35.36% were negative associations.  The frequency of this distribution of associaitons was not significantly different from the frequencies of a randomly generated null distribution (x2 = 0.36, df = 2, p = 0.83).  Future research should focus on constructing and comparing a randomized null  distribution model with empiral data to see if UNTB best explains this seemingly random distribution.       

## 1) INTRODUCTION

Hubbell (2001) developed the unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity (UNTB) to explain the diversity and abundances of species in ecological communities by assuming per capita ecological equivalence among all individuals of every species in the same trophic level. UNTB acts as a null hypothesis for niche-theory by stripping away the complexity and asking: How much of the patterns of ecological communities assembly is explained by species similarity rather than differences (Bell 2000; Hubbell 2001). Hubbell (2006) argues that ecological equivalence can easily evolve in high diversity, dispersal and recruitment limited communities, like in Barro Colorado Island in Panama. In a highly complex environment, species do not evolve or evolves slowly due to low pairwise encounters frequencies between any two species (Hubbell 2006). This idea of species co-occurrence is central to the fundamental assumptions of UNTB, and we aim to explore if indeed this co-occurrences between species on BCI is just by random change. We hypothesize that if community composition in highly diverse ecosystems is primarily determined by neutral processes, then on Barro Colorado Island we expect to observe predominantly random associations for tree species present among sites.

## 3) DESCRIPTION OF DATA

Barro Colorado Island (BCI) was formed in the middle of Gatun Lake (9.1521° N, 79.8465° W) as a reult of the construction of the Panama Canal in Panama in the ealry 20th century.  Since 1923 this island has been the focus of extensive ecological research.  In 1980, a 50 hectare Forest Dynamics Plot was established for the purpose of studying a variety of aspects of tropical ecology.  The first complete tree census was completed in 1982 and have been repeated every 10 years since.  All trees and shurbs > 1 cm in diameter are identifed and counted for this census.  

We took 2010 census BCI 50ha plot dataset that contains long form individual ID number, Species name, Quadrat, PX and PY 50 ha coordinate grid, date censused, status, and DBH. I subsetted the dataset to just include the individual ID number, species name (Latin), Quadrat, and the PX and PY coordinates.

## 6) DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Based on the results of this study we have accepted our alternative hypothesis.  Tree community composition on Barro Colorado Island in Panama consists of predominantly random associations among sites within the 50 hectare plot.  This conclusion was further supported by the random distribution of community indicicence following a similar pattern.  These results justify a more in-depth analysis of the mechanisms that may drive the neutral community arrangement of trees in this area.  A limitation of this study was the lack of investigation into associations based on species abundance within sites.  Instead, this study focused on the incidence of species among sites.  In the future it will be interesting to study associations between tree species on the individual level using abundance data that includes an analysis that estimates the likilhood of homospecific associations.  Creating a randomized null model for tree individual in the 50 ha to test against observed empirical results would provide greater clarity to the co-occurance patterns observed in BCI.  Furthermore, a more in-depth study of mechanisms that are driving community composition would provide a better indiciation of whether tree community composition on BCI is regulated by the assumptions of the Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity.  Overall, since the need for tropical forest conservation is increasing in the face of global change, understading more about the process of community stucture will aid in developing more robust mitigation stratigies for maximizing diversity in tropical ecosystems.
